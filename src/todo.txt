Current TODO for RDS encoding:
- UECP Decoding
- Dynamic PS (may not be implemented)
- Bidirectionality

ASCII commands to implement:
- AF
- Group sequence
- Short RT

ASCII Group seqeunce:
0 - Four 0As
1 - 1A
2 - 2A
A - 10A
E - 14A 14B
X - UDG1
Y - UDG2
R - RT+ 3A 11A
F - 15A

Note that most of this is takes out of pira.cz's P164 RDS Encoder's manual: https://pira.cz/rds/p164man.pdf

I plan for this's commands to be similiar to PIRA32's or P164's (both are made by pira.cz)

In theory, now you can use the MiniRDS as a PIRA32 type device in Magic RDS 4 (but not everything is supported)
